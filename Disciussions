As a group we spoke about the sampling strategy that we were going to use for the algorithms. They were a number that we could choose from. However, we settled on the most basic and simplest, Simple Random Sampling. Essentially, we could use the programming language to generate random array’s and target values for testing. This would ensure that any form of bias was removed from the selection process and enable us to just code for the algorithm itself. And not have to create code to generate random arrays and target values.
With regards to how the testing would work, we had some disagreement. George and Rowan wanted to run the test multiple times (1000) and then take an average and use that. Whereas, I thought anything between 10-50 would be sufficient for the purpose of this exercise. After all, we weren’t looking for a Nobel prize.  
After getting the methods sorted. We decided we would run each algorithm on a different machine. i.e. George would run them all on his computer for his results and we would run them on our machine for our results.
